      General features
    </header>
    <p>Scala is a "C-like" language and will for most parts be intuitive for anyone familiar with another language in this style.</p>
    <p>Some general pointers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Semicolons are optional, and not usually used</p></li>
      <li><p>Types are static and use postfix notation. Type annotations are often optional and inferred</p>
        <pre class="code">
val x: Int = 42
val s: String = "Hello world"
val f: Int => Int = (x: Int) => x + 1
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li><p>The underscore <span class="cmd">_</span> has multiple meanings but is usually a parameter placeholder in anonymous functions</p></li>
      <li><p>Most everything is an expression, e.g. <em class="term">if ... else</em> expressions</p></li>
    </ul>

      Methods and functions
    </header>
    <p>Scala is a dual paradigm language, mixing features from Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming.</p>
    <p>Unlike Java, Scala has in addition to <em class="term">methods</em> the concept of <em class="term">functions</em>. Largely, these can be used interchangeably, but sometimes there is a slight difference.</p>
    <pre class="code">
class Foo(x: Int) {
  def bar(y: Int): Int = x + y
  val zut: Int => Int = (y: Int) => x + y
}

val foo = new Foo(42)
val f = foo.bar _ // f: Int => Int, this type is inferred
val g = foo.zut // g: Int => Int, this type is inferred
    </pre>
    <p>In the code above, <em>f</em> and <em>g</em> are both functions (closures), whereas <em>bar</em> is a method and <em>zut</em> is a function value of the class Foo. Notice how the underscore is used to convert the method into a function.</p>

      Parentheses, periods and the equals sign
    </header>
    <p>Scala's multiparadigm nature and emphasis on DSLs (domain specific languages) has some implications to the use of parentheses and periods.</p>
    <pre class="code">
class Foo(x: Int) {
  def procedure(): Unit { ... } // notice parens &amp; no equals sign
  def accessor: Int = ... // notice equals sign &amp; no parens
}
    </pre>
    <p>Here <em>procedure</em>'s definition includes a pair of parentheses. This means that the caller of the method may or may not include the parens in the method call. The method <em>accessor</em>'s definition does not include parentheses, which means the call site must not either!</p>
    <p>Methods whose return type is <em class="term">Unit</em> (much like Java's <em clas="term">void</em>) are considered procedures. Including the parens in the call site is considered good practise.</p>
    <p>If a method definition lacks the equals sign (<em class="term">=</em>) before the method body, the method is automatically considered a procedure and it's type will be <em>Unit</em>. Forgetting the equals sign is a common pitfall for newer Scala programmers.</p>
    <pre class="code">
val x = 1.+(2)
val y = 1 + 2
    </pre>
    <p>Techically, Scala has no operators, i.e. no special language level parsing of arithmetic or other operators. Instead, everything is a method call.</p>
    <p>Hence, the above forms for <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are equivalent. In fact, the latter form is simply a general syntactic sugaring for methods that take a single parameter; in this case, the <em class="term">+</em> method. This sugaring extends to any user defined functions as well, which is especially nice for DSLs.</p>

      Shorthand notation
    </header>
    <p><em><span class="bigquote">“</span>Brevity is the soul of wit<span class="bigquote">“</span></em>&mdash; William Shakespeare</p>
    <p>Scala offers varying degrees of shorthand notation for function parameters.</p>
    <pre class="code">
val f1: Int => Int = (x: Int) => x + 1
def f2(x: Int): Int = x + 1
def f3: Int => Int = (_: Int) + 1
def f4 = (_: Int) + 1
def f5: Int => Int = _ + 1
def f6: Int => Int = (1+)

val xs: List[Int] = ...
val ys = xs.map(1+)
    </pre>
    <p>All the functions <em>f</em> above denote the same thing: incrementing an integer value by one. The list mapping demonstrates the brevity of the ultimate shorthand notation, here <em>(1+)</em>.</p>
    <p>Of course, sometimes legibility is more important than brevity. Which form is suitable for what context is a question of preference and style left to the reader.</p>

      The great beyond
    </header>
    <p>There is of course much more to Scala than presented here. However, this brief introduction should give you a good idea of the language features you will run into in this tutorial.</p>
    <p>Good luck and hopefully you will enjoy the journey!</p>

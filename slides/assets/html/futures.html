    <p>The next pattern we'll study is Future.</p>
    <p>“Thenables” are a concept which has been recently popularized in the JavaScript world via the Promises/A+ specification, with libraries like Bluebird gaining recognition.</p>
    <p>Futures in Scala are a similar concept, but as we'll soon discover, they conform to the more general pattern of compositionality we have studied in this tutorial.</p>
    <p>Essentially, Future represents an <em>eventual</em> value, available sometime in the future. Having a handle to the eventual value, we can codify ahead of time a kind of pipeline of transformations we wish to perform on the value once it is available. Importantly, these computations can then be whisked off into another thread without blocking the current one.</p>

      Introspection, blocking and callbacks
    </header>
    <p>Once again, let's first see how an eventual value in a Future context can be introspected and unwrapped.</p>
    <p>A value of type Future[A] is either completed or not completed. Once completed, it may have successfully completed or it may have failed. Scala's Future provides <em>isCompleted</em> and <em>value</em> methods, which are both non-blocking and return immediately. The Future's value is an Option[Try[A]] &mdash; None while incomplete &mdash; with concrete Try[A] instances Success[A] and Failure. A Failure always contains a Throwable instance here.</p>
    <p>Callbacks can be attached to either successful or unsuccessful completion, or both, via <em>onSuccess</em>, <em>onFailure</em> and <em>onComplete</em>. Multiple callbacks can be registered, and they may execute immediately or asynchronously, without any guarantee of ordering.</p>
    <p>Finally, a Future <em>f</em> can be blockingly waited on via <em>Await.ready(f)</em> or <em>Await.result(f)</em>. The former returns the Future itself after it is completed, while the latter simply returns its value &mdash; or, throws the exception that had caused the Future to fail, if that is the case.</p>

      Composition using map
    </header>
    <p>While Future's blocking usage is important to know, and callbacks can be useful, Future's true usefulness is revealed through its <em>compositionality</em>, or forming that pipeline of transformations.</p>
    <p>Future's transformations are composed via <em class="term">map</em>, also known as <em class="term">fmap</em>.</p>
    <p>Let's consider for example a library that queries a JSON API for weather data &mdash; specifically, for the current temperature in a given city. A query to the API could be implemented as a blocking HTTP request, but our library's ability to scale might suffer as a result. Let's instead plan ahead and specify that our library returns Futures instead, and somehow schedules the execution of those Futures efficiently behind the scenes.</p>
    <p>But, since the API will return larger lumps of JSON data for each query, how can we extract just the temperature data for our library users, while at the same time returning a handle to the data before we even have it?</p>
    <p>In other words, how to go from this...</p>
    <pre class="code">
def getTemperature(city: String): Future[String] // Raw JSON string with all kinds of data
    </pre>
    <p>...to this?</p>
    <pre class="code">
def getTemperature(city: String): Future[Double] // Current temperature, in &deg;C, of the city
    </pre>
    <p>The solution to this seemingly insurmountable problem lies of course with composition.</p>

    <header class="topic topic-left">
      Composition using flatMap and for yield
    </header>
    <p>Let's take our temperature library to the next level. Say we are planning a holiday in one of two competing cities, but since we like warm, we want to always choose the warmer destination. Our library should be able to take two city names and return the  warmer of the two along with its temperature in a tuple.</p>
    <p>The final iteration of the temperature library should then take a list of city names and select the warmest, returning its name and temperature.</p>
    <p>Futures differ from the previous patterns the way that they deal with a new concern from the real world &mdash; time. This fact creates a special consideration for flatMap. With flatMap, we know we'll be dealing with another future. With Scala's futures, the newly created Future starts running right away in a background thread (pooled from an <em>ExecutionContext</em> behind the scenes). This means that futures joined in the following construct...</p>
    <pre class="code">
for {
  v1 <- createFuture1
  v2 <- createFuture2
}
yield ...
    </pre>
    <p>...execute <em>sequentially</em>. We recall that <em>for yield</em> is simply sugaring for flatMap and map. The flatMapped function, rewritten from the second generator, cannot be run before the value <span class="cmd">v1</span> is available. Hence, the second Future will only start running once the first one has completed.</p>
    <p>If the futures are in fact independently created (we don't need <span class="cmd">v1</span> to kick off the second future), we'd rather that the futures run in parallel.</p>
    <p>To achieve this, we must create both the futures before the for yield expression.</p>
    <pre class="code">
val f1 = createFuture1
val f2 = createFuture2

for {
  v1 <- f1
  v2 <- f2
}
yield ...
    </pre>
    <p>Now, clearly, the futures are created first and will execute in parallel. As in the previous example, the result of the for yield expression is a Future that will complete when both of the joined futures have completed.</p>
    <p>Future.sequence</p>
    <p>Scalaz sequence/sequenceU</p>
    <p>Arbitrary number of cities: sequence, List tie-in</p>
<!--  Composing value with Future.successful  -->
<!--  Future.sequence List[Future[Either[A, B]]] => Future[Either[A, List[B]]]-->

    <header class="topic topic-right">
      Future and Either
    </header>
    <p>We've seen how the default Scala Future contains a Try[A] instance, a type seemingly very similar with Either. However, as it is <em>not</em> an Either, it remains separate and cannot be cross-composed with Either.</p>

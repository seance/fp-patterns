      Option basics
    </header>
    <p>The first functional programming pattern we'll look at is <em class="term">Option</em>, also known as <em class="term">Maybe</em>.</p>
    <p>We're all familiar with methods that return null when no other thing makes sense. Some methods take optional parameters represented by null.</p>
    <p>In both cases, our code will be riddled with null check <span class="cmd">if</span>s, making it verbose, and obscuring the main flow of logic. And should you forget a check, you're setting up for a null pointer exception, potentially killing your thread. <em>Sigh</em>. If only there was a better way.</p>
    <p>There is!</p>
    <p>Option[A] represents a <em>possible</em> value of type A. Option has two concrete instance types, Some[A] and None. Some wraps a value, while None is used when there is no value.</p>
    <pre class="code">
def highFive(x: Int): Option[String] = if (x > 4) Some("High five!") else None    
    </pre>
    
    <p>Option, by grace of its static type, harnesses the compiler to remind us that the value may be missing. Further, while null is not a proper value &mdash; any invocations causing NPEs &mdash; None is, and it fulfills the Option contract.</p>
    <div class="example" data-name="Some wraps a value"></div>
    <div class="example" data-name="None represents a missing value"></div>

      Unwrapping and introspecting
    </header>
    <p>So, now our functions take and/or return Options. But eventually, we'll need the actual, unwrapped value to use it &mdash; that is, if it actually <em>is</em> there.</p>
    <p>To find out, we can use introspection, use <em>get</em> to unwrap the value, or get with a fallback. Let's recall that our Option instances are actually always instances of Some, or None, with Option being an abstract supertype.</p>
    <div class="example" data-name="Introspecting reveals a value is present"></div>
    <div class="example" data-name="Or it may reveal that there is no value"></div>
    <div class="example" data-name="Option's value can be retrieved using get"></div>
    <div class="example" data-name="But getting from None throws an exception"></div>
    <div class="example" data-name="Best practise is to always provide a fallback"></div>

      Composition using map
    </header>
    <p>What we've seen so far hasn't been terribly impressive.</p>
    <p>We've seen how Option may help us with static typing and nulls, but why would we bother to do all this wrapping and unwrapping?</p>
    <p>The answer to this question lies in <em class="term">composition</em>.</p>
    <p>Let's take the example of square root with real numbers. We need a function that computes the square root of a given number, and then adds one to the result. But, as we know, square root is only defined for positive numbers in &#8477;.</p>
    <p>Using traditional means, we'd be stuck with checking for null (or some special value) from the square root before incrementing it:</p>
    <pre class="code">
val result = sqrt(value) // def sqrt(x: java.lang.Double): java.lang.Double
if (result != null)
  increment(result)
    </pre>
    <p>Instead, if sqrt was defined using Option, we could <em>compose</em> the computations using the <em class="term">map</em> composition operator, also known as <em class="term">fmap</em>:</p>
    <pre class="code">
sqrt(value).map(increment) // def sqrt(x: Double): Option[Double]
    </pre>
    <p>This works irrespective of whether the sqrt computation succeeds or not, since the modality of the result is already encapsulated in <em>map</em>'s logic.</p>
    <p>This quality, compositionality, is the key aspect of Option, and of the other patterns.</p>
    <div class="example" data-name="Mapping over Some produces Some"></div>
    <div class="example" data-name="Mapping over None is fine too, and produces None"></div>
    <div class="example" data-name="Things get interesting when combining compositions"></div>

      Composition using flatMap
    </header>
    <p>We've seen how Option can simplify and streamline our code when used compositionally. When composing "simple" computations, we don't need to know whether the Option is defined (Some) or not, since <em>map</em> will do that for us.</p>
    <p>How does map work for Option? Very simply, using basic functions, as it turns out.</p>
    <p>A basic Scala implementation for map, as defined in the Option class might be as follows.</p>
    <pre class="code">
def map[B](f: A => B): Option[B] = this match {
  case Some(x) => Some(f(x))
  case None    => None
}
    </pre>
    <p>Let's consider another computation. For whatever reason, we want to find the 4th root of a given value. Since we already have <em>sqrt</em> handy, let's reuse that implementation.</p>
    <pre class="code">
sqrt(81).map(sqrt) // Option[Option[Double]] = Some(Some(3.0))
    </pre>
    <p>Hmm. It seems the "optionality context" has been doubled (no pun intended!). Further, it's evidenced that we can no longer compose this result with other functions via map:</p>
    <pre class="code">
sqrt(81).map(sqrt).map(increment) // will not compile
// error: type mismatch
//   found   : Double => Double
//   required: Option[Double] => ?
    </pre>
    <p>It seems we cannot compose sqrt with itself in this manner without breaking compositionality. As it turns out, composing a computation that produces another Option is a special case for Option.</p>
    <p>For this purpose, we use the special composition operator, <em class="term">flatMap</em>, also known as <em class="term">>>=</em> or <em class="term">bind</em>.</p>
    <p>The key motivation for understanding the need for having a special operator for composing contextual values is in looking at the end result.</p>
    <p>In a computation involving multiple Option-producing subcomputations, the totality of the "uncertainty" of having a final result does not change &mdash; we either get a value or we don't. Generally this is what we want.</p>

      Composition using for yield
    </header>
    <p>Composing Option-producing computations using <em>flatMap</em> is so useful that there exists a special syntax for it in Scala. In fact, this special syntax works for all the other patterns studied in this tutorial as well. Similar constructs are also found in other languages besides Scala.</p>
    <p>In Scala, this syntax is known as <em class="term">for yield</em> (or alternatively <em>for comprehension</em>). It should not be confused with its cousin <em>for</em> which is useful for side effects.</p>
    <p>The <em>for yield</em> form can be written in two different ways: using parentheses with semicolons, or with curly braces on separate lines.</p>
    <pre class="code">
// parentheses with semicolons    
for (v1 &lt;- gen1; v2 &lt;- gen2) yield expr 
    </pre>
    <pre class="code">
// curly braces on separate lines
for {
  v1 &lt;- gen1
  v2 &lt;- gen2
    ...
  vN &lt;- genN
}
yield expr
    </pre>
    <p>The forms are equivalent, with the latter more suitable when there several <span class="cmd">&lt;-</span> expressions. These expressions are known as generators. For Option, these must be values or computations that produce Option.</p>
    <p>The whole <em>for yield</em> construct itself is an expression, producing a value of type Option[A] where A is the type of <em>expr</em>, when the generators produce Option. The first generator defines the context of the for comprehension, in this case Option.</p>
    <p>It's good to know that the <em>for yield</em> construct is merely syntactic sugaring for <em>map</em> and <em>flatMap</em>. The above construct is rewritten by the compiler to the following form:</p>
    <pre class="code">
gen1.flatMap(v1 => gen2.flatMap(v2 => ... genN.map(vN => expr)))    
    </pre>
    <p>Notably, the last generator will be mapped over while all the previous ones are flatMapped over. This way, the <em>expr</em> does not need to return Option.</p>

    <div class="example" data-name="All the intermediate results are in scope at yield"></div>

      Flattening nested Option instances
    </header>
    <p>There's one more interesting operation available for Options, namely <em class="term">flatten</em>, also known as <em class="term">join</em>.</p>
    <p>Flatten is invokeable on Option instances of type Option[Option[A]]. It flattens the nested structure into Option[A]. It specifically flattens only one level of nesting.</p>
    <p>The three operations, <em>map</em>, <em>flatMap</em> and <em>flatten</em>, along with Option's Some constructor, form an interdependent group.</p>
    <pre class="code">
option.map(f) === option.flatMap(x => Some(f(x)))
option.flatten === option.flatMap(identity)
    </pre>
    <div class="example" data-name="Nested Option instances can be un-nested using flatten"></div>

      Summary
    </header>
    <p>Well done!</p>
    <p>You have now achieved enlightenment on Option through your meditations. Let's summarize what we have learned.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><em class="term">Option</em> aka <em class="term">Maybe</em> is used similarly to null, but offers richer utilities</p></li>
      <li><p>Option enlists the compiler to remind us that a value may be missing</p></li>
      <li><p>None, unlike null, is a proper value with Option semantics</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>Option enables composition of computations</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><em class="term">map</em> aka <em class="term">fmap</em> is used to compose "simple" computations</p></li>
          <li><p><em class="term">flatMap</em> aka <em class="term">>>=</em> aka <em class="term">bind</em> is used to compose Option-producing computations</p></li>
          <li><p><em class="term">flatten</em> aka <em class="term">join</em> can be used to flatten nested Options</p></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A well-crafted piece of software is typically broken in to a loosely coupled but highly cohesive set of units. How these pieces are used in combination, or composed, is therefore of interest. Functional composition offers a uniform, well defined way to do just that, when our units are functions.</p>
    <p>You may now take a moment to admire your virtuosity, and then proceed to meditate on <em class="term"><a href="eithers.html">Either</a></em>.</p>
